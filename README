How to use/launch the app
Note: it is a maven project with dependecies listed in pom.xml

1) Run Client.java from src/main/java UIPackage
2) We have multiple login accounts found in the src/main/resources but for ease of use you can use account with user name and password as 1
3) This Client java file is the only file with a main method since our program components are already connected



IF YOU ENCOUNTER A ERROR WITH GSON PARSING
This is because when zipping our JSON resource files can sometimes have a weird character added to the start of the file when opening it in eclipse.
Removing it so that the JSON file begins with the { character fixed this issue. This must be done to both account.json and UnavaliableCountry.json if bug is encountered.
